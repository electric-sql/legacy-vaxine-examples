# Advanced counter relay

To start the server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Make sure you have Postgres running locally at port 5432 and Antidote at port 8081
  * Initialize databases using `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can access [`localhost:4001`](http://localhost:4001) with cURL or another HTTP client.

Check the README at the umbrella root for more details.
